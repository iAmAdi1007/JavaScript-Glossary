Q. Why use 'type=module' ?

Ans: If we use several different scripts in our HTML files, all the functions/classes etc. present in those files become globally accessible giving rise to multiple issues when working with a big code base.


Q. Do we need to specify 'defer' along with 'type=module' when adding a script tag?

Ans : No, the 'defer' is automatically taken into consideration when using 'type=module'.


Q. What are default exports and when are they generally used?

Ans : When there is a single object to export eg: function, class etc. , we generally make use of default exports.

SYNTAX:
export default <objectName>

To import the file
import objectName from 'filepath/filename'

Q. What is conditional importing?

Ans : In case our imports are expensive server calls and are required only in case when a condition is met, we would not import the required function/object/class. Here we make use of conditional importing which in turn makes use of a function named 'import' which returns a promise.

SYNTAX:

if(true){
    const {functionA, functionB} = await import('filepath/filename')
    functionA()
}

Q. What is IIFE ?

Ans : Immediately Invoked Function Expression is a function which is immediately called after its definition. Can be used for a variety of purpose, most notably to create a function scope to isolate code.

SYNTAX :
(function(){
    console.log('Example of IIFE')
})()
